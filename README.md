Overview of the Coupon Management System's README
An e-commerce platform's Coupon Management System is implemented in this project. Various coupon types (cart-wise, product-wise, and BxGy) can be created, retrieved, updated, deleted, and applied to a cart using the system.

Endpoints for APIs
1. Create a new coupon by posting it to /coupons.
Request Body: JSON object containing the kind and discount details of the coupon.
Cart-Wise Coupon:
{
  "type": "CART_WISE",
  "cartWiseDetails": {
    "threshold": 100,
    "discount": 10
  }
}
Product-Wise Coupon:
{
  "type": "PRODUCT_WISE",
  "productWiseDetails": {
    "productId": 1,
    "discount": 20
  }
}
Buy X, Get Y (BxGy) Coupon:
{
  "type": "BXGY",
  "bxGyDetails": {
    "buyProducts": [
      { "productId": 1, "quantity": 3 },
      { "productId": 2, "quantity": 2 }
    ],
    "getProducts": [
      { "productId": 3, "quantity": 1 }
    ],
    "repetitionLimit": 2
  }
}

2. Get all of the coupons with GET /coupons.
Answer: A list of every coupon that is available.
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "type": "CART_WISE",
    "cartWiseDetails": {
      "threshold": 100,
      "discount": 10
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "type": "PRODUCT_WISE",
    "productWiseDetails": {
      "productId": 1,
      "discount": 20
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "type": "BXGY",
    "bxGyDetails": {
      "buyProducts": [
        { "productId": 1, "quantity": 3 },
        { "productId": 2, "quantity": 2 }
      ],
      "getProducts": [
        { "productId": 3, "quantity": 1 }
      ],
      "repetitionLimit": 2
    }
  }
]

3. GET /coupons/{id}: Use the coupon's ID to retrieve a particular coupon.
Response: The coupon's specifics.
{
  "id": 1,
  "type": "CART_WISE",
  "cartWiseDetails": {
    "threshold": 100,
    "discount": 10
  }
}
4. DELETE /coupons/{id}: Delete a specific coupon by its ID.7
{
  "message": "Coupon with ID 1 has been successfully deleted."
}

5. POST /apply-coupon/{id}: Apply a specific coupon to a cart.
Request Body: Cart object with product details (product ID, quantity, price).
{
  "cart": {
    "items": [
      { "productId": 1, "quantity": 6, "price": 50 },
      { "productId": 2, "quantity": 3, "price": 30 },
      { "productId": 3, "quantity": 2, "price": 25 }
    ]
  }
}

Response: Updated cart with the total price, total discount, and final price.
{
  "updated_cart": {
    "items": [
      { "productId": 1, "quantity": 6, "price": 50, "totalDiscount": 0 },
      { "productId": 2, "quantity": 3, "price": 30, "totalDiscount": 0 },
      { "productId": 3, "quantity": 4, "price": 25, "totalDiscount": 50 }
    ],
    "totalPrice": 490,
    "totalDiscount": 50,
    "finalPrice": 440
  }
}


Unimplemented Cases
1. Coupon Expiration Dates: Reason Not Implemented: Time restrictions prevented the implementation of coupon expiration dates.
Future Improvement Suggestion: Include an expiration date field in the coupon model so that it can determine whether the coupon has expired when it is applied.
2. Nested Coupons: Reason Not Implemented: Stacking coupons, or applying several coupons to a single cart, is not supported by the system.
Future Improvement Suggestion: Use logic to manage several coupon applications and determine the optimal discount.
3. discount Usage Limitations: Reason Not Implemented: There is no restriction on the number of times a client may use a discount.
Future Improvement Suggestion: Establish use caps and monitor individual customer coupon redemptions.

Restrictions
Single Coupon Application: Only one coupon per cart is supported at a time by the current implementation. Applications that use multiple coupons or stacked coupons—that is, cart-wise and product-wise combined—are not supported.

No User-Based Restrictions: There are currently no limitations on the number of coupons that can be used by a single user, and the system does not keep track of who users applied which coupons.

Coupon Expiration Not Implemented: Coupons cannot expire since the current implementation does not handle coupon expiration dates.

Repetition Limits for BxGy Coupons: Depending on the quantity in the cart, the system applies a predetermined limit for BxGy coupons; however, in the future, more sophisticated logic for controlling repetition limits may be introduced.

Future Improvements
Multi-Coupon Support: Support for multiple coupons on a single cart, calculating the best discount or applying all valid coupons.
Coupon Expiry: Add expiration dates to coupons to handle invalid coupons after the expiration period.
User-Based Coupon Restrictions: Track coupon usage by individual users and limit usage based on customer behavior.
Dynamic Discount Calculation: Implement dynamic discount calculations (e.g., discounts based on user history or seasonal promotions).

In conclusion
The effective generation, updating, and use of many kinds of coupons are made possible by this coupon management system. Although a number of features have been added, there are still some restrictions and unresolved issues that may be fixed in later iterations. In an e-commerce platform, the system offers a strong basis for handling discounts and applying them to carts.
